=====> Chapter 3: Admin Backend
Ticket: Migration

Problem: Task
For this ticket, you'll be required to complete the command-line script located in the migrations directory of src called movie-last-updated-migration.js.
Things always change, and a requirement has come down that the lastupdated value in each document of the movies collection needs to be stored as an ISODate rather than a String.
Complete the script so it updates the format of lastupdated using a bulk write. You can find the exact Node.js syntax in the docs.
To perform the migration, run the script:
node movie-last-updated-migration.js
